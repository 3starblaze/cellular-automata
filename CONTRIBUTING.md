# Preface
Hello there! We are happy to have new contributors, no matter the size of a contribution because every bit of help is useful.

This project originally started as a way for me to have a practical experience of managing a project while making something more or less useful. It's mostly an experiment, though there are specific features and goals to be achieved. So we welcome everyone to participate and be a part of this experiment, perhaps as a way to practice your collaboration skills.

# Tools used
Right now we use `black` and `pytest`. To push a change, code needs to be formatted according to `black` and all tests should pass.
